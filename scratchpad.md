    * 1.3.6 - Build Interface Policy Groups
      * 1.3.6.1 - VPC policy for UCS
        * Optional setup I think...not easily scriptable, but these steps are good showing how to create VPC, how to create Int Profile, Switch Profile and AEP
        * May replace this for BM single connections?
  * Missing items:
    * Polcices for APIC interfaces?
* Day 2
  * 1.4 - Building Fowarding (Logical) Constructs
  ![net1](images/net1.png)
    * This assumes VMware integration
    * 1.4.5 - Tenant Creation
      * ***I'd ignore the Security Domains***
    * 1.4.6 - Create VRF
    ![](images/vrf1.png)
      * [ ] Build JSON
    * 1.4.7 - Create BD and Subnets
      ![](images/bd1.png)
      * [ ] Build JSON

      ![](images/subnet1.png)
      * [ ] Build JSON
      * Repeat for another App and vMotion
      * Create Web BD
      ![](images/bdweb1.png)
      * [ ] Build JSON
      ***Revisit how they created the Subnets, who's DG etc***
      * Create NFS BD
      ![](images/bdnfs1.png)
      ![](images/bdnfs2.png)
  * 1.5 Build Application Profile
    ![](images/anp1.png)
    * Create Web and App EPG's and map to associated BD's
    * Create Contracts

      | Contract | Subjects | Filters | Entities |
      | --- | --- | --- | --- |
      | APP_Contract | APP_Services | APP_Service_Ports | ICMP <br> TCP5000 |
    * Provide APP_Contract from APP
    * Consume APP_Contract from Web
  * 1.5.5 VMM integration
    * Steps are good and clear
    * Uses VDS
      * ***I agree with this unless customers wants AVS***
  * 1.6.3-4 Setup L2 out
    * ***Takes a bit more planning work than L3 I think***
* Day 3
  * 1.6 - Setup L3 out
  ![](images/l31.png)
    * Setup using OSPF and default 0.0.0.0/0 external Network
    * Uses routed sub-interface
    * Sets up new Contracts for web -> out
    ![](images/l32.png)
    * Associates WebBD with new L3 out
    * Advertise WebBD Subnet (public subnet scope)
    * Change WebBD subnet and AppBD Subnet to use L3 out for "L3 Out for Route Profile"
* Day 4
  * Service Insertation ***(Should not cover in standard POC)***
* Day 5
  * Software upgrade ***(should be covered)***
  * Switch replacement ***(Should not be covered)***

## Section 2 POC Methodology
* Test Setup
  1.	Verify that the ACI fabric is up and running using the topology screen under the fabric tab.
  2.	Verify that the LLDP/CD neighbors are seen (i.e. the UCS Fabric Interconnects, HP Rackmount servers hosting ESXi)
  3.	Verify using ICMP and HTTP(s) that data plane functionality is working for the remainder of the tenants in the fabric (Tenant01 / Tenant02).
  4. Ensure that these pings are running with the continuous flag set to verify that there is no data plane functionality loss for these tenants at the end of this test case.
* Procedure
  1.	Obtain out of band access for each APIC server.
  2.	Verify the current state of the tenants on the APIC by click on Teants > All Tenants
  3.	Obtain the IP/VLAN information to be used for the Web tier, App tier, the /30â€™s on the external connectivity leg, the loopback addresses for the ACI border leaf and the Nexus 7000 and the verification subnet outside the fabric.
  4.	Create a new Tenant named Tenant03 using the steps outlined in the section Day 2 Part 1: Build ACI Forwarding Constructs
  5.	Create a new application profile named App01 for Tenant03 using the steps outlined in the section Day 2 Part 2: Configuring Application Profile
  6.	Verify that the appropriate port-groups as defined in the application profile (in step 5 above) are now available in Vcenter as a port group under the DVS created by APIC. The configuration / verification steps outlined in the section Day 2 Part 3: Configuring VMM Integration can be used to accomplish this.
  7.	Create an L3-Out connectivity profile for this Tenant using the steps outlined in the section Day 3 Part 1: Connecting Layer 3 Outside
  8.	Verify the ability ACI Attach a web VM and an App VM to the respective port-groups in Vcenter once created.
  9.	Verify the ability to ping the default gateway on the respective bridge-domains on the VM console session.
  10.	Verify the ability to ping through the external network a VM in the Web EPG.
  11. Verify the ability to open up a HTTP session to the VM in the Web EPG.


Items Missing:
* Setup BGP RR
* Create another Tenant for "switched Fabric" with routed SVI outside of ACI
* Setup external switch or BM server
